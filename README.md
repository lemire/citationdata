# Influential references dataset


## What is this?
It is a dataset that might serve as a reference for 
projects in natural language processing, machine learning or 
bibliometrics.


## What problem does it try to solve?

Given a research paper, can you identify the most important references?

## How was the data collected?

Authors of a paper are in the best position
to determine whether a given reference had a strong influence
on their research. In a [blog post](http://tinyurl.com/counting-citations) on March 20th 2012, we invited authors to help us create a gold-standard
dataset of labeled references. 
The authors were directed to fill in an [online form](http://tinyurl.com/influential-references).
The instructions on the form were as follows:

"We believe that most papers are based on 1, 2, 3 or 4 essential references. 
By an essential reference, we mean a reference that was highly influential or 
inspirational for the core ideas in your paper; that is, a reference that inspired 
or strongly influenced your new algorithm, your experimental design, or your choice 
of a research problem. Other references merely support the work. 
We believe that authors are the best experts to assess which references are essential. 
We are interested in automatically finding these references. To know how well we are 
doing, we need your help: please give us the title of a few of your papers and list 
for each paper the references that you feel are most essential, those without which 
the work would not have been possible."

## Can I download the data?

We make the raw data available as we collected it up to March 6th 2013. We only removed the email addresses
that were provided to us. The data is made available under the [ODC Public Domain Dedication and Licence](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/).
